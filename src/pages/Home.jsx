              <p>The UA SynBio Society is a new UA club focused on synthetic biology and getting interested students involved. We are a group of undergraduate students from various majors who are passionate about synthetic biology and its potential to solve real-world problems. Our primary way of creating impact is through facilitating the construction of teams to compete in international synthetic biology competitions, primarily <strong>iGEM</strong>. Our teams will be comprised of students dedicated to creating innovative solutions that can make a positive impact on society.</p>
              <p className="mt-2">We work on projects that involve designing and building biological systems using synthetic biology techniques. Our goal is to contribute to the field of synthetic biology and to inspire others to explore its possibilities.</p>

              <p>The iGEM (International Genetically Engineered Machine) competition is a prestigious global synthetic biology contest that challenges students to design and build biological systems using standard, interchangeable parts called BioBricks. Teams from around the world work on innovative projects that address real-world issues, ranging from environmental sustainability to healthcare.</p>
              <p className="mt-2">The iGEM competition provides a platform for students to collaborate, learn, and showcase their skills in synthetic biology. It fosters creativity, critical thinking, and teamwork, allowing participants to contribute to the advancement of synthetic biology and its applications.</p>
