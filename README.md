# UA SynBio Society / iGEM

Website for UA iGEM, a club I founded at the University of Arizona to compete in the iGEM (International Genetically Engineered Machine) competition. iGEM is a collegiate and professional competition where teams from across the world make projects (generally using synthetic biology) to make the world better. We intend to do the same. This website is meant to display our work and make others think about how they can improve the world through STEM in college. ðŸ¦ ðŸ§ªðŸ§«

### Website made with TailwindCSS v4, JSX, and React (declarative setup with Vite), and Vercel for hosting ðŸ‘¾
